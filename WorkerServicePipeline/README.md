A .NET 8 worker service that executes configurable pipelines and steps using dependency injection and configuration-driven design.

Features
•	Configurable Pipelines: Define which pipeline to run via appsettings.json.
•	Step Factory: Dynamically create and execute steps for each pipeline.
•	Dependency Injection: Uses Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection for service management.
•	Logging: Integrated with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.

How It Works
•	Each Worker reads the pipeline type from configuration and resolves it using DI.
•	Each Pipeline reads its step list from configuration and uses IStepFactory to instantiate each step.
•	Each step implements the IStep interface and is executed in order.

Extending
•	Add a new pipeline: Implement IPipeline and register it in DI.
•	Add a new step: Implement IStep and update IStepFactory to support it.
•	Configure steps: Update appsettings.json to include new steps in the desired pipeline.

Dependency Injection Registration
Ensure all pipelines, steps, and factories are registered in Program.cs:

Running
1.	Update appsettings.json with your pipeline and steps.
2.	Build and run the service

Future Plans
- OpenTelemetry tracing for each step
- Prometheus metrics integration & Grafana dashboard for monitoring
- Structured logging (e.g., JSON logs for better analysis)
- Health check endpoint for service readiness/liveness
- Dead letter queue support for failed messages
- Retry and polling strategies for API calls
- Step parallelization (run independent steps concurrently)
- Retry policies & circuit breaker support for resilience
- Web dashboard for monitoring pipeline status
- Graceful shutdown and in-flight message draining
- Dynamic pipeline/step reloading without restart
- Alerting/notification integration (e.g., Slack, email) on failures
- Centralized configuration management (e.g., Consul, Azure App Configuration)
